# On-Premise
Definition: The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is
sometimes called the “private cloud”.  This deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization

This section is not intended to include operational code to deploy a private cloud as is the definition. Here I will analyze different use case using standard datasets with different languages & libraries outside the cloud

#### >>> THE PLAN ... The following is the list of points that are planned to be covered. Those that include the symbol (!) are those that currently contain information <<<
