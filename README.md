Analyze datasets with different languages


I intend to use this 100DaysOfCloud challenge to master the linux, AWS, and other cloud components of cloud/ data engineering. 


At the end of this challenge I intend to be consistently creating content for all those interested in data and cloud engineering to move into the field as well as landing my first full time role as a data/ cloud engineer by the end of 2020.
