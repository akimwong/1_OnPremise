# On Premise
Definition: The deployment of resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is
sometimes called the “private cloud”.  This deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilization

## Finding Commands With man -k

There will be times when we know what goal we want to accomplish inside the bash terminal but don't know the tool or command that will accomplish this. 

This is where the command

```
man -k
``` 

comes into play.
