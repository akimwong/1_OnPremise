## Overview
In the context of project management, <b>Excel is not a static document, it is a living entity that evolves over time.</p></b>

It grows as new data is added, and the information entered today often triggers actions or dependencies that unfold in the future. Some data takes time to arrive, and its delayed entry can create bottlenecks or slow down progress in other areas.</p>

The first 6 projects in this repository contain code used to:</p>
I.   Visualize information in a graphical way directly from one or more Excel spreadsheets.<br>
II.  Validate, extract, and load the information contained in an Excel file into a MongoDB database (Each record will be timestamped, and a history of changes, including the content of each cell, will be stored.).<br>
III. Take actions or perform analyses based on the information stored in the database.<br>
