<b>Description:</b> Developed parallel implementations in both Python and R to validate the integrity of production data stored in Excel files. <b>The solution compares the structure and content of the production file against a reference file, ensuring that the column names and reference keys have not changed.</b> If the minimum requirements are met, the system proceeds to extract the production data for further processing and analysis. This automated validation step ensures that downstream data pipelines and reporting processes can reliably consume the production data, reducing the risk of errors or inconsistencies.
