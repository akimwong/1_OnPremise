The [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/godaddy-microbusiness-density-forecasting/data) used for this analysis are from a KAGGLE competition called "GoDaddy - Microbusiness Density Forecasting".

## *** THE NEXT DESCRIPTION IS A COPY FROM KAGGLE... ***

- Your challenge in this competition is to `forecast microbusiness activity` across the United States, as `measured by the density of microbusinesses in US counties`.
- Microbusiness activity may be correlated with other economic indicators of general interest.
- This is a forecasting competition.
- A great deal of data is publicly available about counties and `we have not attempted to gather it all here`. You are `strongly encouraged to use external data sources` for features.
