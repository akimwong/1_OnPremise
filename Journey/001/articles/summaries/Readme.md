# How to Build Strong Data Science Portfolio as a Beginner
- Employers are skeptical about hiring new graduates, so how do you convince them that you are best for the job? You display your skills by showing the work you have done in a previous project.
- The stronger your online portfolio, the higher chance you have of getting hired for your dream job.
- The portfolios are extremely critical to have because when you’re in the interview, it shows your real-world experience, so you can explain to an employer from A to Z the entire data science workflow
#### Tips for creating a solid profile: GitHub
1. Create your profile page, and for a complete tutorial, check out Sarah Hart’s blog.
2. Document every project with links, cover images, and detailed descriptions.
3. Fork the project that you like the most and send your first pull request (freecodecamp.org).
4. Be active on this platform by contributing, bug reporting, and pushing your current projects.

#### Deepnote:
Is much simpler than GitHub, and it's beginner-friendly too. If you are familiar with Jupyter notebook then it will be a piece of cake for you to publish your first project.
#### DAGsHub:
Comes with a DVC server, MLflow, Visualizing pipeline, and GitHub Synchronization
DAGsHub allows you to share your GitHub repository and create your data science project with the ability to visualize machine learning and data pipelines. 
#### Kaggle:
If you want to get noticed faster in the world of data science, you should create a Kaggle account and start contributing to competitions, datasets, notebooks, and discussions. 
Create a Kaggle profile while learning the basics. Learn from experts and discover your niche.
#### Blog:
Writing blogs are the next step after creating your project on the above platforms. If you want to expand your audience, I will highly suggest you start with Medium.
#### Portfolio Website:
You can also display your project on a personal website, and if you are not a web developer, there are some simple tools available to make the process quite easy. 
#### Weight & Biases:
You can write a blog about your current project by using embedded links and graph integration. It is quite similar to other portfolio platforms I mentioned, but it comes with the perk of direct integration with Python libraries.

# 3 must-know advanced analytics for understanding your customers
(Top Use-cases for customer analytics and how to do them)

- The success of your business depends upon how well you understand your customers.
- Every industry will analyse customers in a different way. 
- However the top 3 customer analytics across all industries are the following:
1.	Customer Segmentation
2.	Customer Journey Analysis
3.	Marketing Attribution

## 1. Customer Segmentation
- It will group similar customer into segments. 
- So now you can send an email message per segment. 
- As customers in a segment are similar, you can tailor the message for each segment. 
- Also as you save lot of time, as you are creating message for each segment and not for each customer.
- Here are some techniques which you can use for customer segmentation

1.1. Heatmap — making segments based on pre-selected columns

</p>

1.2. Making segments based on multiple columns
- However in many situations, you do not have specific columns in mind to make segments. 
- Clustering is a way to make segments using multiple columns. 
- Clustering groups similar data records based on multiple columns into clusters or segments.
- The analysis is to have three segment, so there are three colors.
- Some of the columns which determine the clusters are `age, marital, education, job`.

## 2. Customer Journey Analysis
- Helps understand how customers interact with you in a chronological order. 
- It helps you understand customer experience overtime. 
- It encompasses all customer interactions across all channels, devices and touch-points throughout every stage of the customer lifecycle — from awareness to loyalty.
- Here are some techniques to understand customer journey:

2.1. Path Analysis
- (In the example) we can determine the pattern of vehicle rented over time. 
- As we can see that top paths for vehicle category are Compact — Prime

</p>

2.2. Sankey Chart
- Represent the chronological events in a flow style visualisation. 
- Shown below is all paths taken by customers. For example customers start with Sedan and then go towards Automatic cars.
- And this kind of analytics can be useful to in different ways — for example anticipating which path customer might take and then making product recommendations

## 3. Marketing Attribution
- `Is key to let customer know about you and buy from you`. 
- And now-a-days there are various channels for marketing. 
- `How do you decide effectiveness of the marketing channels? This is where attribution is useful as it helps you “attribute” the customer conversion to different channels`.
- Here are some techniques which will help you making marketing attribution:

3.1. Channel Attribution analysis
