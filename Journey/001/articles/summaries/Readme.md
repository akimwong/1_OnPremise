# How to Build Strong Data Science Portfolio as a Beginner
- Employers are skeptical about hiring new graduates, so how do you convince them that you are best for the job? You display your skills by showing the work you have done in a previous project.
- The stronger your online portfolio, the higher chance you have of getting hired for your dream job.
- The portfolios are extremely critical to have because when you’re in the interview, it shows your real-world experience, so you can explain to an employer from A to Z the entire data science workflow
#### Tips for creating a solid profile: GitHub
1. Create your profile page, and for a complete tutorial, check out Sarah Hart’s blog.
2. Document every project with links, cover images, and detailed descriptions.
3. Fork the project that you like the most and send your first pull request (freecodecamp.org).
4. Be active on this platform by contributing, bug reporting, and pushing your current projects.

#### Deepnote:
Is much simpler than GitHub, and it's beginner-friendly too. If you are familiar with Jupyter notebook then it will be a piece of cake for you to publish your first project.
#### DAGsHub:
Comes with a DVC server, MLflow, Visualizing pipeline, and GitHub Synchronization
DAGsHub allows you to share your GitHub repository and create your data science project with the ability to visualize machine learning and data pipelines. 
#### Kaggle:
If you want to get noticed faster in the world of data science, you should create a Kaggle account and start contributing to competitions, datasets, notebooks, and discussions. 
Create a Kaggle profile while learning the basics. Learn from experts and discover your niche.
