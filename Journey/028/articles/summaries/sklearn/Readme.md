# 7 Scikit-Learn Best Practices For Data Scientists
(Tips for taking full advantage of this machine learning package)

## 1. Use Scikit Learn (and not Pandas) for feature engineering
- While the `Pandas library is excellent for conducting exploratory data analysis`, it can not compare to Scikit Learn in the machine learning space.
- The `transformers` in Scikit Learn are designed for `machine learning applications`.
- `Shoehorning Pandas functions into a data pipeline with other Scikit Learn tools will inevitably lead to inefficient procedures that are prone to error`.
