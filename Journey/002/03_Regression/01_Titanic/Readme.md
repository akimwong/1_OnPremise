### 1. Structure Investigation

- Number of columns and rows:
- Number of data types that those features include:

1.1. Structure of non-numerical features

(Even though "sex" is a numerical feature, it somehow was stored as a non-numerical one. This is sometimes due to some typo in data recording. These kind of things need to be taken care of during data preparation.)

- Number of unique values each non-numerical feature has
- Frequency the most prominent value is present

1.2. Structure of numerical features

How many unique values each of these feature has. This process will give us some insights about:

- Number of binary (2 unique values)
- Number of Ordinal (3 to ~10 unique values)
- Number of continuous (more than 10 unique values) features in the dataset.

1.3. Conclusion of structure investigation

Have a better understanding of the general structure of our dataset.
Number of samples and features, what kind of data type each feature has, and how many of them are binary, ordinal, categorical or continuous.
