# Interpreting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The Objectives of EDA are to discover underlying patterns, spot anomalies, frame the hypothesis and check assumptions with the aim to find a good fitting model (if one exists)
- At a more granular level, EDA involves understanding the relationship between variables including determining relationships among the explanatory variables;
- Assessing the relationships between explanatory and outcome variables (direction and rough size estimates);
- The presence of outliers
- Ranking of the important explanatory variables; 
- Conclusions as to whether individual explanatory variables are statistically significant.
