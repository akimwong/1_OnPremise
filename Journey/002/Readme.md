# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALISYS (EDA)

The objectives of EDA are:
- Discover underlying patterns
- Spot anomalies
- Frame the hypothesis
- Check assumptions with the aim to find a good fitting model (if one exists)

At a more granular level:
- EDA involves understanding the relationship between variables including determining relationships among the explanatory variables; 
- Assessing the relationships between explanatory and outcome variables (direction and rough size estimates); 
- The presence of outliers; 
- A ranking of the important explanatory variables; 
- Conclusions as to whether individual explanatory variables are statistically significant.

### Categorising EDA techniques

Are either:
- Graphical (summarize the data in a diagrammatic or visual way)
- Quantitative (normally involve calculation of summary statistics) <br/>

(Non-graphical and graphical methods complement each other, we can see graphical methods as more qualitative (providing subjective analysis) vs quantitative methods as objective)

Each of these techniques are in turn:
- Univariate (look at one variable (data column) at a time)
- Multivariate (usually just bivariate) (look at two or more variables at a time to explore relationships).
