# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALISYS (EDA)

The objectives of EDA are:
- Discover underlying patterns
- Spot anomalies
- Frame the hypothesis
- Check assumptions with the aim to find a good fitting model (if one exists)

At a more granular level:
- EDA involves understanding the relationship between variables including determining relationships among the explanatory variables; 
- Assessing the relationships between explanatory and outcome variables (direction and rough size estimates); 
- The presence of outliers; 
- A ranking of the important explanatory variables; 
- Conclusions as to whether individual explanatory variables are statistically significant.

### Categorising EDA techniques

Are either:
- Graphical
- Quantitative

Each of these techniques are in turn:
- Univariate
- Multivariate (usually just bivariate).
